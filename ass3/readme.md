Run the code
```
g++ <filename>.cpp -std=c++14
./a.out
```
Input format -

```
Input consists of two lines.
First line contains two integers n and key denoting the size of array and element to be searched respectively.
Second line contains n space seperated integers denoting the elements of array in non decreasing order.

```
Output format -

```
* First line contains Zero based Index of the key element to be searched and -1 if that element does not exist using 
  standard binary search.
* Second line contains number of iterations occuring in standard binary search.
* Third line contains Zero based Index of the key element to be searched and -1 if that element does not exist using 
  improved binary search.
* Fourth line contains number of iterations occuring in improved binary search.
```

### Theory
* We are required to return the index of the element key in the array Arr which is sorted in non-decreasing order.We return -1 if key doesn’t occur in Arr.
* In this algorithm we not only compare the middle element of our search space with key but also compare key with left and right bounds , so that we don’t take many iterations to find elements present at the ends.

---

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**
<br>
* Best case for this algorithm would be when key is present at either of mid , end or start of the array Arr. => T = Ω(1)
* In worst case , T = O(logN) 
* We can conclude that by using heuristics we can optimise binary search algorithm in the worst case as well as average case.


**Space Complexity**
<br>Since no extra space is used in this algorithm , so auxiliary space is constant. Only the input array is of size n. So , Space Complexity = Input Space + Auxiliary Space = O(n), this Algorithm uses linear Space.
